Consequently, both responses are of similar quality in content.\n\nIn terms of style, Assistant A's response had a more focused and direct tone, acknowledging the information gap and suggesting the importance of due diligence.

Both assistants failed to simplify the content enough for a young child to understand.\n\nComparing the content, Assistant A explains gravitational potential as related to energy required to bring an object to rest, mentioning the energy needed to lift out of a gravitational field. Assistant B highlights gravitational potential energy as a concept tied to an object's position in a gravitational field. However, neither assistant effectively explains why this energy is specifically negative.\n\nIn terms of style, Assistant A's tone seems more detailed and paced, while Assistant B's explanation is more repetitive, possibly making it slightly harder to follow. Given the request to explain nervously like to a five-year-old, which neither assistant fulfills, Assistant A's style is marginally better in clarity.\n\n[Verdict]\n{\n    \"content\": \"C\",\n    \"style\": \"A\",\n    \"overall\": \"A\"\n}"}

Hence, in terms of content, both are equally accurate and relevant in addressing the user's query.\n\nStyle Aspect: The user specifically requested the information to be delivered in the style of a politician. Assistant A's response lacks any particular characteristics or rhetoric common to a politician's style and is quite straightforward. On the other hand, Assistant B also does not particularly adopt a political style but is slightly more engaging by expressing hope that the user is having a great Friday, which could be interpreted as a more personable or diplomatic approach.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n[Verdict]\n{\n    \"content\": \"C\",\n    \"style\": \"B\",\n    \"overall\": \"B\"\n}"}

Assistant B also fails to present an embarrassed tone and is overall convoluted.\n\nGiven the incorrectness of both answers and the failure to address the requested tone, the content aspect is a tie since both responses are equally inadequate.

Assistant A fails to deliver in this aspect, not completing the joke and instead offering an unnecessary analysis.\n\nRegarding the Style aspect, Assistant B also is more aligned with the user's request, as the response is delivered in a casual, joking manner consistent with a Cockney accent.

Therefore, B's response is relatively more informative regarding the user's query.\n\nRegarding style, Assistant B's response is slightly more helpful and patronizing in tone.
