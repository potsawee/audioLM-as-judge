    # Prepare the prompt

    Originally, a judge was asked to determine the relationship between A and B, on providing verdicts on three categories: "content", "style", and "overall". If the judge worked properly, the verdicts should be in a JSON format already like:
    {{
        "content": "X",
        "style": "Y",
        "overall": "Z"
    }}

    Analyze the following text and determine the relationship between A and B (it might already be in the correct JSON format, if not please make one for me). Respond with one of the following:
    - A: 'A is better than B'
    - B: 'B is better than A'
    - C: 'A and B are equally good'

    Note that A might also be reffered to as Assistant A or first option, and B might also be reffered to as Assistant B or second option.

    Text: "{text}"

    You must strictly output the JSON format like this:
    {{
        "content": "X",
        "style": "X",
        "overall": "X"
    }}
    where X is one of "A", "B", or "C" based on your analysis. Do not include any additional information. Your output will be parsed by `json.loads` in Python, so don't include any other text.
