      "when the jellyfish are swimming, the tentacles contract so they are about 150 mm (5.9 in) long and about 5 mm (0.20 in) in diameter; when they are hunting, the tentacles are thinner and extend to about 3 m (9.8 ft) long. the tentacles are covered with a high concentration of stinging cells called cnidocytes, which are activated by pressure and a chemical trigger; they react to proteinous chemicals. box jellyfish are day hunters; at night they are seen resting on the ocean floor.\n",
      "in common with other box jellyfish, c. fleckeri has four eye-clusters with 24 eyes. some of these eyes seem capable of forming images, but whether they exhibit any object recognition or object tracking is debated; it is also unknown how they process information from their sense of touch and eye-like light-detecting structures due to their lack of a central nervous system. they are attracted to light of different colors (white, red, orange, yellow, green and blue), but blue light seems to elicit a feeding behavior, as it slows down their pulsation rate and makes them stream out their tentacles.[8] black objects, on the other hand, cause them to move away.[7]\n",
